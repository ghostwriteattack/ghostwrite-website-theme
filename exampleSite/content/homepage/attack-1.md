Example Attack operates by exploiting a flaw in the processor's memory
management, allowing malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to sensitive
data. When triggered, the attack infiltrates the system through a carefully
crafted code, which takes advantage of the erroneous behavior.

Once inside, the attacker navigates through the processor's architecture,
circumventing security protocols and accessing cached data that should have been
purged. This outdated information might include confidential user credentials,
financial records, or other sensitive data points. The attackers can then use
this pilfered data for various malicious purposes, such as identity theft,
financial fraud, or unauthorized access to secure systems.

What makes Example Attack particularly insidious is its ability to go undetected
for extended periods, making it challenging for security measures to identify
and mitigate the breach promptly.
